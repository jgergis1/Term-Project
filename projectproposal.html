    <h1>Project Propsal for Website about Egypt</h1>
    <p>I will make a website about my country Egypt.The website will feature a page about egyptian food and cusine, local tourist attractions, music, history, and politics. The general target audience is going to be people who like to travel and are interested in travelling to the Middle East or North Africa region. This website is important because it contributes to the toursim ecosystem my countries economy depends on. On the different pages I will include pictures, videos, and links to other pages that can educate my audience further on certain subjects.</p>
